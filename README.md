# Full Basics Data Science Knowledge
***
## In this Repository i like to summarize everything i have learned over two years learning about data science

**it is important to know that in many cases I assume that you already know certain terms, languages, frameworks and tools, if you do not know about python I recommend you my [repository](https://github.com/byshadowoz/Algorithms_in_python)(not finished, only in spanish) about python algorithms where I also teach the basics of python.**

## How do i look this repository?
1. [Maths](https://github.com/byshadowoz/Data_Science_Full_Basic/tree/main/Maths) This module is to know how the machine larning models works and types of analitical and predictive maths (not obligatory)
2. [Big Data](https://github.com/byshadowoz/Data_Science_Full_Basic/tree/main/Big%20Data) In this module I'd explain the basic of Big Data Hadoop, Apache Spark, MapReduce(), etc...
3. [Databases](https://github.com/byshadowoz/Data_Science_Full_Basic/tree/main/Databases) In Databases modules i would try to explain concepts and how works a Database, i will be focus on SQL Databases but i will tried to explain NoSQL also.
4. [Machine Learnings](https://github.com/byshadowoz/Data_Science_Full_Basic/tree/main/Machine_learning) This has three modules
   - [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/byshadowoz/Data_Science_Full_Basic/tree/main/Machine_learning/Supervised%20Learnng) Fundamentals of   Regression and clasification models 
   - [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/byshadowoz/Data_Science_Full_Basic/tree/main/Machine_learning/Unsupervised%20Learning) in process...
   - [Cross Validation](https://github.com/byshadowoz/Data_Science_Full_Basic/tree/main/Machine_learning/Cross%20Validation) This module mix Unsupervised and Supervised models and focus and how to find the best model and parameters for the dataset in each
5. [Visualization](https://github.com/byshadowoz/Data_Science_Full_Basic/tree/main/Visualization) This module is for create data visualizations in Python
